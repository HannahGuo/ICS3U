changes. A random number of stones is generated at the beginning of the game. Two players then take turns taking 1, 2
or 3 stones from the total number of stones. The player who takes the last stone loses. This program offers both a
player vs computer mode and a player vs player mode.
Program Assumptions - This program requires a computer that has Python 3.6.5 installed. It has been tested using the
Windows 10 OS, but should also be compatible on Mac OS.
Features of Program - This program has numerous improvements over it's original description. First, there is now a
player vs player mode in addition to the computer vs player mode. The computer vs player also has several new features.
There is the original regular mode for the computer that randomly makes a move, and there is also the expert mode
where the computer's answer is calculated. The player also has the option of making the first move, or letting the
computer make the first move. Both player vs computer and player vs player keeps track of the players' win/loss record.
