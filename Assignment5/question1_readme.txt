Unit 5 / Question #1
Programming Language - Python 3.6.5
Problem Description - This program is a number guessing game. The computer randomly generates a number between 1 and
the specified cap and the user has a certain amount of guesses to guess the number. The cap and the amount of guesses
varies per game mode, where easy has a cap of up to 10 and 5 guesses, medium has a cap of up to 25 and 6 guesses, hard
has a cap of up to 50 and 7 guesses and challenger has a cap of 100 and 8 guesses. If the user guessed incorrectly, the
program will give them a hint on if the computer's number is higher or lower than their guess. The program keeps track
of the player's wins and losses in each mode, and only ends if the player quits.
Program Assumptions - This program requires a computer that has Python 3.6.5 installed. It has been tested using the
Windows 10 OS, but should also be compatible on Mac OS.
Features of Program - The program now has different modes of varying difficulties. The program is also continuous and
loops until the user types in 'quit' and confirms their decision. To make the game more fun, the program also outputs
if the player's guess is higher or lower than the computer's number so that their next guess can be closer to the
answer. In addition to keeping track of wins, the program also keeps track of losses for each mode. In order for prints
to be more grammatically correct, there are two functions that take in a number parameter and output the appropriate
form of the inputted word.
Restrictions - None
Known Errors - None
Implementation Details / How to Build Programs - Not Applicable
