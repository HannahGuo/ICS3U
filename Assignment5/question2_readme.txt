Unit 5 / Question #2
Programming Language - Python 3.6.5
Problem Description - This program is a game of Arcade Dice. The user starts off with 1000 coins, and their goal is to
increase this amount to at least 10000. This is done by betting their current coins and predicted the outcome of the
sum of two rolled dice. The user guesses "low" when they think that the sum of the two dice will be between 2 and 6,
and "high" if they predict the sum of the two dice will be between 8 and 12. If the user guessed correctly, they will
receive the amount of coins they bet. If they guess incorrectly, they will lose the amount of coins they bet. No coins
are gained or lost if a 7 is rolled). The user only has 10 bets, and can only make bets up to 1500 coins at a time.
Program Assumptions - This program requires a computer that has Python 3.6.5 installed. It has been tested using the
Windows 10 OS, but should also be compatible on Mac OS.
Features of Program - The program now has a goal where the user wins (when 10000 coins is reached within 10 bets).
Another element added is that the user may only make bets up to 1500 coins. The program also keeps tracks of wins and
losses. It also runs continuously until the user says to quit.
Restrictions - None
Known Errors - None
Implementation Details / How to Build Programs - Not Applicable
Additional Files - Not Applicable
