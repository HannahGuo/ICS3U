Unit 4 / Question #1
Programming Language - Python 3.6.2
Problem Description - This program acts as a calculator and can perform the addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, exponent, modulus, square root and cube root operations. It accepts a number, followed by the operation,
then the second number from user inputs, then outputs the solution. (Except in the square root and cube root operators,
where it performs the specified operation to the first number entered.)
Program Assumptions - This program requires a computer that has Python 3.6.2 installed. It has been tested using the
Windows 10 OS, but should also be compatible on Mac OS.
Features of Program - The program can now calculate the square root and cube root of the entered number, and has a while
loop containing a try/except/else block for each number input to check if the entered value is a number (not a string).
Restrictions - Unfortunately, the program is not able to calculate the square or cube root for negative numbers.
Known Errors - None
Implementation Details / How to Build Programs - Not Applicable
Additional Files - Not Applicable
