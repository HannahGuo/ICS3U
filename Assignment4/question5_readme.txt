Unit 4 / Question #5
Programming Language - Python 3.6.2
Problem Description - This program identifies properties of triangle based on user inputs. The user has the option to
enter in a triangle's three angles or three sides. Based on these inputs, the program will output the triangle's type
based on side length (equilateral, isosceles or scalene) and the triangle's type based on angles (right angle, obtuse
or acute).
Program Assumptions - This program requires a computer that has Python 3.6.2 installed. It has been tested using the
Windows 10 OS, but should also be compatible on Mac OS.
Features of Program - The program can now accept three angles as an alternative input option to three sides. It also
outputs whether the triangle is obtuse, acute or has a right angle. Finally, each number input option checks if a number
has been entered (i.e. not a string) using a try/except/else block.
Restrictions - None
Known Errors - None
Implementation Details / How to Build Programs - Not Applicable
Additional Files - Not Applicable
