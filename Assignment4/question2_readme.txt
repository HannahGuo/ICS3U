Unit 4 / Question #2
Programming Language - Python 3.6.2
Problem Description - This program provides the average and median grade for a teacher's class after they have entered
how many students are in their class and the grades those students received. It also outputs how many students are in
each (A to F), how many passed or failed the course, the percentage of students that received each grade and the
percentage of how many passed or failed the course. The program also runs continuously until the user tells it to quit
at the end of each class.
Program Assumptions - This program requires a computer that has Python 3.6.2 installed. It has been tested using the
Windows 10 OS, but should also be compatible on Mac OS.
Features of Program - In addition to tracking how many students are within each grade range, how many have passed and
failed, and the class average, the program also calculates the class median and  has a while loop containing a
try/except/else block for each number input to check if the entered value is a number (not a string). The program also
calculates the percentage of students that have each grade, as well as the percentage of how many students passed or
failed. The program also runs continuously and another class can be calculated after the preceding one.
Restrictions - None
Known Errors - None
Implementation Details / How to Build Programs - Not Applicable
