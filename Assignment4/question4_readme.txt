Unit 4 / Question #4
Programming Language - Python 3.6.2
Problem Description - This program prints out the "Necklace Problem" that was introduced in the program's problem. The
'necklace' problem starts off with the user inputting two positive single-digit integers. The next number of the
necklace is obtained by finding the one's digit column of the sum of the two previous digits. The necklace ends when
the two numbers that were entered are repeated (in succession).
Program Assumptions - This program requires a computer that has Python 3.6.2 installed. It has been tested using the
Windows 10 OS, but should also be compatible on Mac OS.
Features of Program - The program is now continuous, meaning that once the user calculates one necklace, they have the
option to enter in another or end the program. It also has a while loop containing a try/except/else block for each
number input to check if the entered value is a number (not a string).
Restrictions - None
Known Errors - None
Implementation Details / How to Build Programs - Not Applicable
Additional Files - Not Applicable
