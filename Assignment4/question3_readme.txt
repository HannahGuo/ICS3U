Unit 4 / Question #3
Programming Language - Python 3.6.2
Problem Description - This program calculates either the factorial or double factorial of the user's inputted number.
The program receives the mode (factorial or double factorial) and number from the user.
Program Assumptions - This program requires a computer that has Python 3.6.2 installed. It has been tested using the
Windows 10 OS, but should also be compatible on Mac OS.
Features of Program - The program now has the ability to calculate the double factorial. It can also handle when an
integer value is entered as a float (for example, if 5.0 was entered instead of 5) and has a while loop containing a
try/except/else block for each number input to check if the entered value is a number (not a string).
Restrictions - None
Known Errors - None
Implementation Details / How to Build Programs - Not Applicable
Additional Files - Not Applicable
